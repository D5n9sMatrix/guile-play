; 4 Programming in Scheme

; Guile’s core language is Scheme, and a lot can be achieved simply by using Guile to write and run Scheme programs — as opposed to having to dive into C code. In this part of the manual, we explain how to use Guile in this mode, and describe the tools that Guile provides to help you with script writing, debugging, and packaging your programs for distribution.

; For detailed reference information on the variables, functions, and so on that make up Guile’s application programming interface (API), see API Reference.
