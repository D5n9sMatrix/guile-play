; 4.1 Guile’s Implementation of Scheme

; Guile’s core language is Scheme, which is specified and described in the series of reports known as RnRS. RnRS is shorthand for the Revised^n Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme. Guile complies fully with R5RS (see Introduction in R5RS), and is largely compliant with R6RS and R7RS.

; Guile also has many extensions that go beyond these reports. Some of the areas where Guile extends standard Scheme are:

;    Guile’s interactive documentation system
;    Guile’s support for POSIX-compliant network programming
;    GOOPS – Guile’s framework for object oriented programming.
