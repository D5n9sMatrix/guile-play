; 4.4.1 The Init File, ~/.guile

; When run interactively, Guile will load a local initialization file from ~/.guile. This file should contain Scheme expressions for evaluation.

; This facility lets the user customize their interactive Guile environment, pulling in extra modules or parameterizing the REPL implementation.

; To run Guile without loading the init file, use the -q command-line option.
