; 4.4 Using Guile Interactively

; When you start up Guile by typing just guile, without a -c argument or
; the name  of a script to  execute, you get an  interactive interpreter
; where you can  enter Scheme expressions, and Guile  will evaluate them
; and print the results for you. Here are some simple examples.

; scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 3 4 5)
; $1 = 12
; scheme@(guile-user)> (display "Hello world!\n")
; Hello world!
; scheme@(guile-user)> (values ’a ’b)
; $2 = a
; $3 = b

; This mode of use is called a REPL, which is short for “Read-Eval-Print
; Loop”, because the  Guile interpreter first reads  the expression that
; you have  typed, then evaluates it,  and then prints the  result.  The
; prompt shows  you what language and  module you are in.  In this case,
; the  current   language  is   scheme,  and   the  current   module  is
; (guile-user). See Section  6.24 [Other Languages], page  465, for more
; information on Guile’s support for languages other than Scheme.
