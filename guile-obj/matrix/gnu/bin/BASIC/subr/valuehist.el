; 4.4.3 Value History

; Just  as Readline  helps you  to reuse  a previous  input line,  value
; history allows you to use the result of a previous evaluation in a new
; expression. When value  history is enabled, each  evaluation result is
; automatically assigned  to the next  in the sequence of  variables $1,
; $2,  .  .  .  .  You  can  then  use  these  variables  in  subsequent
; expressions.

; scheme@(guile-user)> (iota 10)
; $1 = (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)
; scheme@(guile-user)> (apply * (cdr $1))

(iota 10)

; $2 = 362880
; scheme@(guile-user)> (sqrt $2)
; $3 = 602.3952191045344
; scheme@(guile-user)> (cons $2 $1)
; $4 = (362880 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)

(sqrt $2)
(cons $2 $1)

; Value history is enabled by  default, because Guile’s REPL imports the
; (ice-9 history) module.  Value history may be turned off  or on within
; the repl, using the options interface:

; scheme@(guile-user)> ,option value-history #fc
; scheme@(guile-user)> ’foo
; foo

; scheme@(guile-user)> ,option value-history #t
;scheme@(guile-user)> ’bar
; $5 = bar


; Note that  previously recorded  values are  still accessible,  even if
; value  history  is  off.  In  rare cases,  these  references  to  past
; computations can  cause Guile to use  too much memory.  One  may clear
; these   values,  possibly   enabling  garbage   collection,  via   the
; clear-value- history! procedure, described below.

(use-modules (ice-9 history))

value-history-enabled?

; Return true if value history is enabled, or false otherwise

enable-value-history!

;Turn on value history, if it was off.

disable-value-history!

; Turn off value history, if it was on.[Scheme Procedure]
clear-value-history!

; [Scheme Procedure] Clear  the value history. If the  stored values are
; not captured by some other data structure or closure, they may then be
; reclaimed by the garbage collect
