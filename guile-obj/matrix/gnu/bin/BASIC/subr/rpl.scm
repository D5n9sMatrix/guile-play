; 4.4.4 REPL Commands

; The REPL  exists to  read expressions, evaluate  them, and  then print
; their results. But sometimes one wants to tell the REPL to evaluate an
; expression in a  different way, or to do something  else altogether. A
; user  can affect  the way  the REPL  works with  a REPL  command.  The
; previous section had an example of  a command, in the form of ,option.
; scheme@(guile-user)>   ,option    value-history   #t    Commands   are
; distinguished from expressions  by their initial comma  (‘,’). Since a
; comma cannot begin an expression in most languages, it is an effective
; indicator to the REPL that the  following text forms a command, not an
; expression.   REPL commands  are  convenient because  they are  always
; there.  Even  if  the  current  module  doesn’t  have  a  binding  for
; pretty-print, one can always ,pretty-print.

,option    value-history   #t

; The following sections document the various commands, grouped together
; by function- ality.  Many of the commands have  abbreviations; see the
; online help (,help) for more information.
