; 3.2 The Representation and Use of Procedures

; This section introduces the basics of using and creating Scheme procedures. It discusses the representation of procedures as just another kind of Scheme value, and shows how procedure invocation expressions are constructed. We then explain how lambda is used to create new procedures, and conclude by presenting the various shorthand forms of define that can be used instead of writing an explicit lambda expression.
